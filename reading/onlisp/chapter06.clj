; Chapter 6, entitled "Functions as Representations"

; As always, I will post when the code is "complete", but my progress can be followed on [Github](http://github.com/fogus/polyglot/tree/master/reading/onlisp).  Also, this post is executable, just copy and paste into a Clojure REPL.

(comment I do believe that it would be more fruitful to pass over the interesting, yet esoteric, chapter 6 for the more interesting _at least for a n00b.clj like me_ chapter 7 addressing macros.)
